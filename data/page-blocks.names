3. Past Usage:
   This data set have been used to try different simplification methods
   for decision trees. A summary of the results can be found in:

   Malerba, D., Esposito, F., and Semeraro, G.
   "A Further Comparison of Simplification Methods for Decision-Tree Induction."
   In D. Fisher and H. Lenz (Eds.), "Learning  from Data: 
   Artificial Intelligence and Statistics V", Lecture Notes in Statistics,
   Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1995.

   The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page
   layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation
   process. This is an essential step in document analysis
   in order to separate text from graphic areas. Indeed, 
   the five classes are: text (1), horizontal line (2),
   picture (3), vertical line (4) and graphic (5).
   For a detailed presentation of the problem see:

    Esposito F., Malerba D., & Semeraro G.
  Multistrategy Learning for Document Recognition
         Applied Artificial Intelligence, 8, pp. 33-84, 1994

   All instances have been personally checked so that
   low noise is present in the data.

4. Relevant Information Paragraph:

   The 5473 examples comes from 54 distinct documents. 
   Each observation concerns one block. 
   All attributes are numeric.
   Data are in a format readable by C4.5.

5. Number of Instances: 5473.

6. Number of Attributes 

   height:   integer.         | Height of the block.
   lenght:   integer.     | Length of the block. 
   area:     integer.    | Area of the block (height * lenght);
   eccen:    continuous.  | Eccentricity of the block (lenght / height);
   p_black:  continuous.  | Percentage of black pixels within the block (blackpix / area);
   p_and:    continuous.        | Percentage of black pixels after the application of the Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) (blackand / area);
   mean_tr:  continuous.      | Mean number of white-black transitions (blackpix / wb_trans);
   blackpix: integer.    | Total number of black pixels in the original bitmap of the block.
   blackand: integer.        | Total number of black pixels in the bitmap of the block after the RLSA.
   wb_trans: integer.          | Number of white-black transitions in the original bitmap of the block.



7. Missing Attribute Values:  No missing value.
